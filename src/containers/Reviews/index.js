              {`Tiffany was my manager at Skechers when I first joined. She 
              really impressed me with her vast knowledge of the Skechers 
              architecture and how quickly she was able to prototype large 
              front end systems. As a leader, Tiffany demonstrated time and 
              again how she can take charge of situations and break down 
              complex problems for her team to solve. She understood the 
              nuances of each team member and was able to delegate 
              responsibilities that played to their strengths. Every person I 
              work with speaks admirably of all that she did at Skechers and I 
              would happily recommend Tiffany to be a part of any software 
              development team. Her natural energy, curiosity, and passion for 
              coding can help push any project forward.`}

               you can count on to show up curious, driven, and excited to push
               for the best results. She has an innate ability to scope out 
               projects and identify edge cases for features and bugs that can 
               cause multiple round trips. Of all of her skills, she has the 
               ability to get work done no matter the difficulty of the 
               project. I'm glad to call her my manager, mentor, and especially

              the rate at which she learns and absorbs information is just a 
              little bit frightening. When the web department grew to such a

              incredible manager, an incredible engineer, and an incredible

              dedicated teammates I have had the opportunity to work with in my
              career. She is focussed and will always find the solution to a
              problem. An excellent JavaScript developer, who pretty much owns
              Angular, she is constantly striving to learn more. Every week, she
              was reading a new book on code, taking a course on pluralsight, or
              getting into a new podcast. Any company would be lucky to have her
              as a member of their team.

              a new book on her desk as she was keeping up to date in this fast
              paced industry. Tiffany will always get the job done regardless 
              of what roadblocks are in front of the task at hand. She is a 
              dedicated employee and will spend the extra time outside of work 
              to ensure things are done correctly. She can hop into an 
              existing, unfamiliar codebase and ramp up quickly even if there

              developer and learns new technologies blazingly fast. She works
              very quickly, but never compromises the quality of her work.
              Tiffany is a perfectionist and is mindful of maintaining the
              integrity of a design throughout the entire development process.
              She is a fervent believer in web standards and utilizes standards
              compliant and adaptive coding techniques. Tiffany sets high
              standards for herself and inspires her teammates to do so as well.
              She never backs down from a challenge; she will figure out a way
              to make the impossible work, and make it work very well. She keeps
              an eye on changes in the industry to ensure her skillset is fresh

              I have worked with Tiffany at two different companies (Inter-tech

              As a web developer, she always included something creative or
              inventive that the project manager or client had not thought of.
              Tiffany is also extremely FAST. She picks up on new things very
              quickly and can implement code rapidly for a variety of project
              types including e-commerce solutions, database driven websites,
              and other complicated websites. She can also do flash animation,
              graphic design, and occasionally dabbles in creating her own apps
              for Facebook and other platforms just for fun. I definitely
              recommend Tiffany for any web development project.
